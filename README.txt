Dataset - CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32 x 32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

Fake Image Generating using GANs describes the whole objective of my
project. So GAN is a neural network that can generate new realistic data from scratch. For
example, it can create images (which are fake) like cars, birds, monkeys, or whatever it is trained
to generate from random noise as its input. In a realistic world, there are situations when data is
limited, and sometimes it is expensive, and time-consuming to collect data. In that scenario,
GAN plays a vital role in creating new data that looks realistic enough. As we know, all Machine
Learning and Deep Learning algorithms stick to some primary objective, i.e., recognizing the
pattern in the given data. Like here, GAN discovers structure in the data that allows them to
generate realistic data. And this can be useful.
